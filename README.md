# lru-cache-build

Built a cache based on least recently used.

#Made use of double linkedlist so i can be able to keep insert and delete nodes at constant time in my cache.

#Also made use of dummy nodes so i can be able to simplify the process of inserting removing nodes from the link.

#Built helper functions for this purposes, to cleanup my code.

#Used an hashmap to point to the nodes.
